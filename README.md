# Expression-Parser
This began as a side project to my terrain project. It was originally intended to be a lite-weight system for parsing and evaluating matematical expressions, but it soon evolved into a full api that allows for customization of functions and operators. I decided to break it off into its own repository in case I ever decide to continue working on it.
